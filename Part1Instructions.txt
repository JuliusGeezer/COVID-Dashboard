Call the scrape_country function. There are three total inputs, one mandatory, and two optional. 
You must input the url for the worldometer website. It is provided on the comments of the code, if you do not have it.
The second input is an optional country input. Inputting this will retrieve the stats associated with that counrty.
If it is not given, the function will output stats for all countries. Third is an optional stat input. Here you can
request a specific stat. Type in "TotalDeaths", "NewDeaths", "Deaths/1M pop", or "New Deaths/1M pop" as these are the
available stats. Without this input, the function will return all the stats for the given country. Otherwise,
it will only output the requested stat for that country.

Examples:
print(scrape_country("https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/", "Sweden", "TotalDeaths"))
print(scrape_country("https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/", "Cameroon"))
print(scrape_country("https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/"))

These examples are all valid inputs.
